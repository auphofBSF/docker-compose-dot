### Building the most current version or a customized version

> _Whilst a Makefile exists this will not build on a windows machine. The Makefile has not been tested with this authors contributions_

**requirements** 
	- [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on a windows or linux machine
	- a git repostitory to clone from


		git clone {FROM a GIT REPOSITORY A docker-compose-dot COMMIT}
**to build**

		vagrant up

**to retrieve the built docker image**

		vagrant ssh
		docker save -o /vagrant/build/docker-compose-dot.dockerImage digibib/docker-compose-dot

on the targert machine remove prior docker images of **docker-compose-dot**
> ie.  `docker rmi ` image 

on the host machine copy the `./build/docker-compose-dot.dockerImage` file to the target machine and `docker load -i docker-compose-dot.dockerImage`

to rebuild the docker image on build host machine whilst vagrant virtual machine instance is still up

		vagrant ssh -c /vagrant/rebuildInVagrant.sh

on completion when required tear down the vagrant build instance

		vagrant destroy


You will need the Graphviz package to convert dot to image formats.
